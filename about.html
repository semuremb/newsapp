			Welcome to Primary News! As the name suggests, this is the one stop shop for US primary source news. 
			U.S. House bills, U.S. Senate bills, lobbying disclosures, and more can be found right here.
			For those who don't want to pore through dozens of bills and cases, you'll be able to read 
			Primary News original articles on the most important stuff. New articles will be coming out every day, 
			so you don't wanna miss out!
			<br>
			We live in a time where reality is nearly indistinguishable from the lies we are saturated with every day.
			Media outlets will manipulate and omit information for their own gain, pushing an agenda that's often 
			detrimental to us. 
			<br><br>
			<h2>Our mission: Compile this information for everyone to see, then let people draw their OWN conclusions.</h2>
			<br><br>
			Starting with Primary News v1.0, that era of manipulation and omission is over. We're entering a 
			new age of information.
